"""User-facing offset notifications — the app-layer toast owner.

Replaces the legacy NotificationHandler AND the pending-notification dance
OffsetManager used to run inline (``_maybe_send_pending_notification`` plus the
provisional-suppression block in ``apply_audio_offset``). Everything about
"should a toast fire, and which message" now lives here, driven by typed
events on the dispatcher thread:

* ``OffsetApplied`` — an automatic apply. A provisional apply (the stream is
  not yet STABLE) does NOT toast; its message is HELD on
  ``session.pending_notification`` and released on the session's next
  ``StreamStabilized``. A non-provisional apply toasts immediately and clears
  any pending hold.
* ``StreamStabilized`` — releases a held provisional toast, but only if the
  profile still keys the same setting id it was held under: a profile that
  changed underneath drops the stale toast (settings-doctrine — never toast a
  stale key). The setting id is re-derived FRESH from ``session.profile`` at
  release time.
* ``UserOffsetSaved`` — a manual adjustment the AdjustmentWatcher stored.
  Toasts from the event's own profile/ms (captured at store time on the
  dispatcher thread); session/settings are deliberately NOT re-read.

Deferral-until-stable and the 1s duplicate-suppression window are both ported
from the legacy path. The dedupe clock is the injected ``time.monotonic`` — a
deliberate upgrade from the legacy ``time.time``, which mis-measured the
window across wall-clock adjustments.

Settings (``notifications_enabled`` / ``notification_duration_ms``) are read
through the injected facade; toasts go through the injected gui. Pure app
layer: stdlib + ``resources.lib.aom`` only.
