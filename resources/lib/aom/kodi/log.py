"""Kodi logging adapter: a callable ``(message, level)`` sink.

Replacement for the legacy ``resources.lib.logger.log`` (deleted with the
Phase 7 splits). The legacy
module imported the settings machinery and re-checked the debug toggle on EVERY
log call — a logger<->settings import knot that this layer unties. The adapter
instead holds a plain cached ``debug_escalation`` flag: the runtime seeds it
once at construction (from a value the caller reads out of settings) and
refreshes it on Kodi's ``SettingsChanged`` callback. No settings import here, so
the logger stays a leaf.

The cached flag is a bare attribute deliberately. Its only writer is the
runtime's ``SettingsChanged`` handler (Kodi's callback thread) and its only
reader is the dispatcher thread; a stale read costs at most one log line's
level (LOGDEBUG vs LOGINFO) and nothing else, so it carries no lock.

The escalation and prefix behavior are ported verbatim from the legacy
``log()``: a LOGDEBUG line escalates to LOGINFO when the addon debug toggle is
on (so users can capture addon debug lines without turning on Kodi-wide debug),
and a message already prefixed ``AOMe_`` or ``[AOM]`` is not double-tagged.

This layer may import ``xbmc*`` and ``resources.lib.aom.*`` only.
