    Do not seek until there has been no seek activity — ours, another

    give up ``deadline`` seconds after the request. A request that another
    of our own seeks has already served (executed AT or AFTER the moment
    this request was made — same-instant counts as served, the safe side
    against a double rewind) is abandoned: its purpose — replaying the
    glitched seconds — is done (the legacy cross-type cooldown's job).

    Args (all timestamps monotonic; the caller resolves them):
        now: current time.
        requested_at: when this seek was requested.
        last_activity: most recent seek-like activity — any SeekOccurred,
            vendor busy signal, our own executed seek, or session start
            (session start counting as activity is what reproduces the
            legacy 2s post-start settle without a bespoke constant).
        last_own_seek: when WE last executed a seek this session, or None.
        quiet_window: required quiet seconds before seeking.
        deadline: max seconds after requested_at before giving up.

        a request that aged past the deadline is abandoned even if the
