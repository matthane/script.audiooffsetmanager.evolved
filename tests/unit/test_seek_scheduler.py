"""Unit tests for aom.app.seek_scheduler (SeekScheduler + ExternalSeekCoordinator).

Driven exactly like test_stream_detector / test_dispatcher: a FakeClock plus
Dispatcher.run_pending() pumping, with a Rig that assembles the scheduler on
fakes. Seeks are observed through FakeGateway.seeks (a list of
(seconds, player_id)); reciprocity/vendor signals through its
window_properties.

Timing facts the tests rely on (from the module):

* ExecuteSeek attempt #1 is scheduled at delay 0, so it fires on the NEXT
  pump with no clock advance; a deferred attempt re-schedules RECHECK (0.5s)
  later, key-replaced so only one attempt per reason is ever live.
* The session's ``started_at`` counts as seek activity, so a fresh seek must
  wait QUIET_WINDOW (2.0s) from playback start before it can execute — this
  is how the legacy mandatory 2s post-start settle is reproduced.
* Per-reason DEBOUNCE (2.0s) is measured from that reason's last EXECUTED
  seek; DEADLINE (8.0s) is measured from the request.
* Seeks execute only when ``session.stream_state is STABLE``; tests reach
  STABLE via the session's own transitions (mark_profile_built + mark_stable)
  and give the session a real StreamProfile so player_id resolves.

Race note (pinned, not incidental): when two reasons become eligible on the
SAME pump, the reason whose attempt-chain started FIRST fires first (lower
scheduler seq perpetuates through the lock-step 0.5s reschedules). Tests that
depend on cross-type ordering exploit this deterministically.
