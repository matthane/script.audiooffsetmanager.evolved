"""Unit tests for aome.domain.policies.seek_decision — the seek quiet-window
policy stated as one pure function.

These are pure table tests (no dispatcher, no clock, no fakes): the caller
resolves every timestamp and the function only decides 'seek' | 'defer' |
'abandon'. The scheduler-side enforcement (rescheduling, deadline bounding,
cross-type suppression as it actually plays out on the bus) is pinned in
test_seek_scheduler.py; here we pin the decision math and, crucially, its
DOCUMENTED ORDERING: served-check, then deadline, then quietness.

All timestamps are monotonic floats; only their differences matter, so the
tables use small readable numbers.
