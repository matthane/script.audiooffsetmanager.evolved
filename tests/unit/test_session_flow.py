"""Integration-style session flow tests on fakes (phase-gate evidence).

Wires the REAL ServiceRuntime graph (dispatcher, tracker, detector, platform
recorder, offset applier, notifier, seek scheduler, adjustment watcher) under
Kodistubs, with the Kodi I/O seams swapped: every gateway consumer gets one
scriptable FakeGateway, every clock-holding component the same FakeClock (so
probe/verify/seek/watch timers are driven deterministically with
run_pending), settings reads are monkeypatched on the single Settings
adapter, and applies/toasts are captured at the gateway/notifier boundaries.

Covers: provisional apply -> release on STABLE, late-codec probe chasing,
in-place reopen supersession, stale detector-event inertness, AV-change
storms collapsing to one apply, blip-revert suppression, failed-RPC retry,
the applied-before-RPC watcher contract (both boundary-pinned and end-to-end
via real watch ticks), seek quiet-window timing from session start, and
post-stop AV events.
