"""Contract test: the offset-settings matrix in resources/settings.xml.

The addon keys every stored offset by `<hdr>_<fps>_<audio>`. There must be one
integer setting per combination of the format vocabulary, with the exact
-1000/+1000/25 constraints. This pins all 315 ids and cross-checks the
vocabulary against the runtime consumer (the stream detector's pure
derivation), so a drift between the code's vocabulary and the shipped
settings (which silently means "no offset found") fails the build.
